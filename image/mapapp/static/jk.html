    Srinagar tranquil Dal Lake mirrors floating gardens and ornately carved shikaras gliding through mist, while the fringed Mughal gardens burst into riotous bloom each spring. To the south, Jammus terraced hills cradle the sacred
    Vaishno Devi shrine, drawing tens of thousands of pilgrims along winding mountain paths. In the heart of Kashmir Valley, Gulmarg powdery slopes transform into a skier paradise each winter, then bloom into wildflower meadows as
    spring melts the snow. Pahalgam, with its rushing Lidder River and cedar forests, lures trekkers seeking both solitude and sweeping vistas. The fields of Pampore perfume the air with autumns saffron harvest, where crimson stigmas
    are still plucked by hand at first light. Artisans in the old city of Srinagar carry forward centuries-old traditions spinning Pashmina wool into gossamer shawls, weaving intricate carpets, and painting papier treasures in
    jewel-bright hues. Every evening, the aroma of Rogan Josh, Yakhni, and Kashmiri kebabs drifts through alleyways, while cups of cardamom-scented kahwa warm chill fingers. In every season, Jammu and Kashmir weaves together rugged 
    natural grandeur and a tapestry of cultural heritage, leaving visitors with memories as vivid as its mountain sunsets.</p>
